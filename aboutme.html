  <h2>VOLLEYBALL</h2>
  <p>Volleyball is my favorite sport of all time. What I like about volleyball is that it is different from other sports; it not
    driven by pride but by teamwork and momentum. That means all your players are crucial, despite their position. Nonetheless,
    I played volleyball to have fun and celebrate every win as a team.</p>

  <h2>WORKOUT</h2>
  <p>Nothing can come between me and my dumbbells. I workout 5 times a week. It became a part of my lifestyle because I benefit from it in so many ways.
    Not only it helps me live a healthier life but also gives me the confident I needed to go about my day. If I ever need to rejuventate my mind, the gym is the answer.
    An important I learned through workingout is that whatever goals you set for yourself, with effort, consistency and dedication you will achieve it.</p>

  <h2>GAMING</h2>
  <p>What is better than hooking yourself up with some strategic action on Vainglory. Gaming has always been my ultimate source of entertainment.
    it is what I enjoy doing most when I'm bored. Gaming is not as bad as it seem, because I think it allows room for creativity and more,
    depending on what type of game you play.</p>
