  <h2>How It Came To Be</h2>
  <p>Some believe that it is by chance that the universe existed. I'm not here to refute this particular concept of its existence,
    but to inform why I believe what I believe. That is the universe was created by a powerful mind and an eternal being known as God. He brought all creation into existence and breathe all
    creatures into live.</p>

<div id="content2">
  <h1>To Be a Human Being...</h1>
  <p>... one must live meaningfully and purposely with values. As humans, we are curious to why we are here. We wonder why we exist. All along, we all have this sense of purpose to whom do we live for.
    The answer is presented infront of us, but it is up to each individual to choose what kind of live they want. Through experience, death is inevitable for everyone. On the bright side, immortality will be
    granted in heaven if you believe in him. Heaven or hell? you choose.</p>
