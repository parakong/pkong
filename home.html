    <h2>WHO IS PARAMOUNT?</h2>
    <p>I'm a senior at Logos International School. I'm very friendly and sweet and has good vibes. I like challenges of any form because I want to see my capabilities and fill in the skill I lack.
      Since puberty, I have always desired to achieve something big in life to impress my asian family. I have an artistic talent, but failed to take advantage of it because I'm not proud of it.
       In the near future, I will be going to college to get a degree in a major of my interest and look for what life has in store for me. If you ever see me in the hall way or on the street,
       don't be afraid to say hi.</p>
